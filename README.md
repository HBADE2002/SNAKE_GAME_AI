# SNAKE_GAME_AI
A SNAKE GAME WHICH IMPROVES ITSELF USING MACHINE LEARNING.

In this project I have used the pytorch, pygame, matplotlib and other python libraries to create a SNAKE GAME, which uses reienforcement learning to improve 
itself and score higher points.

This project is very informative as it introduces new concepts and applications of the concepts we learn in ML in a real case scenario, here we also get exposure to pytorch,  
PyTorch is an open source machine learning (ML) framework based on the Python programming language and the Torch library. It is one of the preferred platforms for deep learning research.
Pygame helps us make a simple game and we use it to make the snake game.
